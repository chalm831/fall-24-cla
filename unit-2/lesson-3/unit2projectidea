I want to use marovify to explore the idea of translation. I originally thought that using song translations especially from a website like genius which not only provides translations but also has song meaning transcriptions. I also was planning to use an album that had very rich conceptual ideas. Rosalis siphmore album means a lot to me as a body of work that blends genres but also because of the stroy it tells. Opon reflection and thinking of this idea and Maites claim (i have yet to verify) that scraping lyric websites is hard. I find myself trying to understand how to maybe evolve or get around this. Firts, I think thranslation? wat I need to comfirm wether or not what Maite is saying is true and i need to scrape as much as i can to see if there really isnt a way. Second if thats the case then I need to reconsider how xan i still explore translation? maybe books, interviews, movie scripts that have been translated. But i want to see what markovify writes based on these translations and how that compares to what the original text in spanish was meaning to say.
