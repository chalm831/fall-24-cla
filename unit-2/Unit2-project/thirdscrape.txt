 When it comes to love, some people would say it is one of the most important human emotions. Love is a set of emotions and behaviors characterized by intimacy, passion, and commitment. It involves care, closeness, protectiveness, attraction, affection, and trust.


 Many say it's not an emotion in the way we typically understand them, but an essential physiological drive. 





Love is a physiological motivation such as hunger, thirst, sleep, and sex drive.



 — 
PSYCHOLOGIST AND BIOLOGIST ENRIQUE BURUNAT





 There are countless songs, books, poems, and other works of art about love (you probably have one in mind as we speak!). Yet despite being one of the most studied behaviors, it is still the least understood. For example, researchers debate whether love is a biological or cultural phenomenon.


5 Psychological Theories of Love

  How Do You Know You're Feeling Love for Someone?  
 What are some of the signs of love? Researchers have made distinctions between feelings of liking and loving another person.


  Zick Rubin's Scales of Liking and Loving  
 According to psychologist Zick Rubin, romantic love is made up of three elements:


 Attachment: Needing to be with another person and desiring physical contact and approvalCaring: Valuing the other person's happiness and needs as much as your ownIntimacy: Sharing private thoughts, feelings, and desires with the other person


 Based on this view of romantic love, Rubin developed two questionnaires to measure these variables, known as Rubin's Scales of Liking and Loving. While people tend to view people they like as pleasant, love is marked by being devoted, possessive, and confiding in one another. 


  Are There Different Types of Love?  
 Yup—not all forms of love are the same, and psychologists have identified a number of different types of love that people may experience.


 These types of love include:



Friendship: This type of love involves liking someone and sharing a certain degree of intimacy.
Infatuation: This form of love often involves intense feelings of attraction without a sense of commitment; it often takes place early in a relationship and may deepen into a more lasting love.
Passionate love: This type of love is marked by intense feelings of longing and attraction; it often involves an idealization of the other person and a need to maintain constant physical closeness.
Compassionate/companionate love: This form of love is marked by trust, affection, intimacy, and commitment.
Unrequited love: This form of love happens when one person loves another who does not return those feelings.

  Robert Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love  
 Specifically, psychologist Robert Sternberg developed his well-regarded triangular theory of love in the early 1980s. Much research has built upon his work and demonstrated its universality across cultures.


 Sternberg broke love into three components—intimacy, passion, and commitment—that interact to produce seven types of love.

  Is Love Influenced By Biology or Culture?  
Love is most likely influenced by both biology and culture. Although hormones and biology are important, the way we express and experience love is also influenced by our own conceptions of love.
 Some researchers suggest that love is a basic human emotion just like happiness or anger, while others believe that it is a cultural phenomenon that arises partly due to social pressures and expectations. 


 Research has found that romantic love exists in all cultures, which suggests that love has a strong biological component. It is a part of human nature to seek out and find love. However, culture can significantly affect how individuals think about, experience, and display romantic love.


Is Love an Emotion?
Psychologists, sociologists, and researchers disagree somewhat on the characterization of love. Many say it's not an emotion in the way we typically understand them, but an essential physiological drive. On the other hand, the American Psychological Association defines it as "a complex emotion." Still, others draw a distinction between primary and secondary emotions and put love in the latter category, maintaining that it derives from a mix of primary emotions.
  How to Show Love to Another Person  
 There is no single way to practice love. Every relationship is unique, and each person brings their own history and needs. Some things that you can do to show love to the people you care about include:


 Be willing to be vulnerable.Be willing to forgive.Do your best, and be willing to apologize when you make mistakes.Let them know that you care.Listen to what they have to say.Prioritize spending time with the other person.Reciprocate loving gestures and acts of kindness.Recognize and acknowledge their good qualities.Share things about yourself.Show affection.Make it unconditional.


Does Unconditional Love Make Healthy Relationships?

  How Love Impacts Your Mental Health  
 Love, attachment, and affection have an important impact on well-being and quality of life. Loving relationships have been linked to:


 Lower risk of heart diseaseDecreased risk of dying after a heart attackBetter health habitsIncreased longevityLower stress levelsLess depressionLower risk of diabetes

  Tips for Cultivating Love  
 Lasting relationships are marked by deep levels of trust, commitment, and intimacy. Some things that you can do to help cultivate loving relationships include:



Try loving-kindness meditation. Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is a technique often used to promote self-acceptance and reduce stress, but it has also been shown to promote a variety of positive emotions and improve interpersonal relationships. LKM involves meditating while thinking about a person you love or care about, concentrating on warm feelings and your desire for their well-being and happiness.
Communicate. Everyone's needs are different. The best way to ensure that your needs and your loved one's needs are met is to talk about them. Helping another person feel loved involves communicating that love to them through words and deeds. Some ways to do this include showing that you care, making them feel special, telling them they are loved, and doing things for them.
Tackle conflict in a healthy way. Never arguing is not necessarily a sign of a healthy relationship—more often than not, it means that people are avoiding an issue rather than discussing it. Rather than avoid conflict, focus on hashing out issues in ways that are healthy in order to move a relationship forward in a positive way. 


What Are the Five Love Languages?

  Negative Emotions Associated With Love  
 As Shakespeare said, the course of love never did run smooth. Love can vary in intensity and can change over time. It is associated with a range of positive emotions, including happiness, excitement, life satisfaction, and euphoria, but it can also result in negative emotions such as jealousy and stress.


 No relationship is perfect, so there will always be problems, conflicts, misunderstandings, and disappointments that can lead to distress or heartbreak.


 Some of the potential pitfalls of experiencing love include:



Anxiety
Depression
Increased stress
Jealousy
Obsessiveness
Possessiveness
Sadness


 While people are bound to experience some negative emotions associated with love, it can become problematic if those negative feelings outweigh the positive or if they start to interfere with either person's ability to function normally. Relationship counseling can be helpful in situations where couples need help coping with miscommunication, stress, or emotional issues.

  History of Love  
 Only fairly recently has love become the subject of science. In the past, the study of love was left to "the creative writer to depict for us the necessary conditions for loving," according to Sigmund Freud. "In consequence, it becomes inevitable that science should concern herself with the same materials whose treatment by artists has given enjoyment to mankind for thousands of years," he added.﻿﻿


 Research on love has grown tremendously since Freud's remarks. But early explorations into the nature and reasons for love drew considerable criticism. During the 1970s, U.S. Senator William Proxmire railed against researchers who were studying love and derided the work as a waste of taxpayer dollars.


 Despite early resistance, research has revealed the importance of love in both child development and adult health.﻿﻿
