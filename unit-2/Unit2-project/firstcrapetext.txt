       I don’t know what love is, can someone explain it to me? 







    I know when some people say that they do things for you, that it is love. But I always felt that it had to be something more than that. No one in my life seems to know what i’m looking for or doesn’t care to help me with this.
  
    I don’t think I ever felt it emotionally. It only feels like a word to me sometimes. How are you supposed to feel like when you love someone in any type of way?
